# Even Search method of optimization 

## Project Description
It is a software for searching solutions of optimization problems for a random allowed accuracy.


Given:
*	An analytic expression for random full mathematical function f(x);
*	An optimized specification for finding the optimized value of solving variable;
*	A structure of interface form that implements iterative method - Even Search Method.

To do:
*	Develop a softfare for searching solutions of optimization problems for a random allowed accuracy;
*	Write a code for searching a solution of problems for a random given allowed accuracccy
*	Prove that the optimized solution with accuracy not more than allowed accuracy is found
